<p>Business.</p>
<p>OraSure Technologies transforms health through actionable insight by powering the shift that connects people to healthcare wherever they are.</p>
<p>In February 2023, the Company announced a corporate restructuring to combine the commercial and innovation teams across two segments, being the</p>
<p>&quot;Diagnostics&quot; segment and the &quot;Molecular Solutions&quot; segment, into one business unit with sales, marketing, product development and research teams</p>
<p>covering multiple product lines. This change is intended to accelerate innovation, enhance customer experience and result in operational synergies. As a</p>
<p>result, all products and services reside under one reporting hierarchy. The Company's product portfolio is broadly divided into diagnostics products and</p>
<p>sample management solutions.</p>
<p>Products and Services</p>
<p>The Company's business consists of the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of simple, easy to use diagnostic products and specimen collection</p>
<p>devices using its proprietary technologies, as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on</p>
<p>other specimen types. Our diagnostic products include tests for diseases including COVID-19, HIV and Hepatitis C that are performed on a rapid basis at</p>
<p>the point of care, and tests for drugs of abuse that are processed in a laboratory. These products are sold in the United States and internationally to various</p>
<p>clinical laboratories, hospitals, clinics, community-based organizations, and other public health organizations, distributors, government agencies,</p>
<p>physicians’ offices, and commercial and industrial entities. The Company's COVID-19 and HIV products are also sold in a consumer-friendly format in the</p>
<p>over-the-counter (&quot;OTC&quot;) market in the U.S. and, in the case of the HIV product, as a self-test to individuals in a number of other countries, including as an</p>
<p>oral swab in-home test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 in Europe.</p>
<p>The Company's business also includes molecular sample management solutions and services that are used by clinical laboratories, direct-to-consumer</p>
<p>laboratories, researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and animal health service and product providers. The revenues from sample management solutions are</p>
<p>derived from product sales to commercial customers and sales into the academic and research markets. Customers span the disease risk management,</p>
<p>diagnostics, pharmaceutical, biotech, companion animal and environmental market segments. The Company has also developed collection devices for the</p>
<p>emerging microbiome market, which focuses on studying microbiomes and their effect on human and animal health. The Company also has a urine</p>
<p>collection device which allows for the volumetric collection of first void urine. This product is in its early stages, and initial sales are occurring primarily</p>
<p>through distributors and collaborations in the liquid biopsy and sexually transmitted disease markets. Additionally, the Company offers laboratory and</p>
<p>bioinformatics services for both genomics and microbiome customers. These services are primarily provided to pharmaceutical, biotech companies, and</p>
<p>research institutions.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Company expanded its market focus by selling existing collection products for use with COVID-19 tests. Beginning in 2022 and continuing</p>
<p>through 2023, demand for COVID-19 PCR testing declined significantly, which was primarily driven by the availability of antigen tests, the reduction in</p>
<p>the number of COVID-19 cases, and the wider availability of vaccines that negatively impacted the sales of the collection products.</p>
<p>Business Update Related to InteliSwab&reg; Covid-19 Rapid Tests</p>
<p>In June 2021, the Company received three Emergency Use Authorizations (&quot;EUA&quot;) from the FDA for its InteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid Tests</p>
<p>(&quot;InteliSwab &quot;) for non-prescription OTC, professional point-of-care use and prescription home use. The Company began recording revenues on the sales</p>
<p>of its InteliSwab tests during the third quarter of 2021. In January 2022, the Company received FDA authorization for pediatric use of InteliSwab&reg; tests</p>
<p>for children ages 2 to 14. In September 2023, the Company received FDA approval for extension of InteliSwab&reg; test shelf-life from 18 months to 24</p>
<p>months. In September 2021, the Defense Logistics Agency (&quot;DLA&quot;) awarded the Company a procurement contract for the InteliSwab&reg; tests for OTC use,</p>
<p>which the DLA estimated to have a value of &#36;205 million and which would provide InteliSwab tests to up to 20,000 sites throughout the United States. On</p>
<p>November 22, 2022, the DLA awarded the Company a second procurement contract for the InteliSwab tests for OTC use. In 2023, the Company delivered</p>
<p>18 million tests under the contract, which ran from November 2022 through November 2023. In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and</p>
<p>Human Services (&quot;HHS&quot;) awarded the Company a fully funded firm fixed price contract for a total of 3.2 million InteliSwab tests which were delivered in</p>
<p>February 2023.</p>
<p>In September 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (&quot;BARDA&quot;), which is part of the</p>
<p>office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at HHS, pursuant to</p>
<p>&reg;</p>
<p>&reg;</p>
<p>&reg;</p>
<p>&reg;</p>
<p>&reg;</p>
<p>&reg;</p>

<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>which BARDA would provide up to &#36;13.6 million in funding to obtain clearance of a premarket notification (&quot;510(k)&quot;) and Clinical Laboratory</p>
<p>Improvement Amendments of 1988 (&quot;CLIA&quot;) waiver of the InteliSwab tests. The Company continued development work and analytical testing on this</p>
<p>test throughout 2023. However, in early 2024, the Company has communicated to BARDA that it does not intend to pursue further development of this</p>
<p>product.</p>
<p>Through 2023, the Company maintained its expanded United States production capacity for InteliSwab tests to meet capacity targets, set out in its 2021</p>
<p>contract with the U.S. Department of Defense (&quot;DOD&quot;) (in coordination with the HHS), of more than 100 million tests annually.</p>
<p>In 2023, the Company announced that the FDA provided approval for a new packaging and labeling configuration for InteliSwab&reg; tests. The Company</p>
<p>completed the transition to this new configuration in March 2023, which resulted in lower shipping costs, less packaging and reduced truckloads.</p>
<p>Products</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the Company's principal products for the infectious disease and risk management markets as well as its sample management</p>
<p>products:</p>
<p>InteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid Test</p>
<p>InteliSwab is the Company's rapid immunoassay product designed to test nasal samples for the presence of antigen from SARS-CoV-2. The device uses an</p>
<p>integrated swab to collect a specimen from the lower nostril. After collection, the integrated swab is inserted into a vial containing a pre-measured amount</p>
<p>of developer solution to facilitate flow of the sample into the device. The specimen and developer solution flow through the test device and test results are</p>
<p>observable in 30 minutes. The InteliSwab test has received EUA from the FDA for non-prescription, OTC home use in individuals aged two years or</p>
<p>older, with symptoms within the first seven (7) days of onset when tested at least twice over a three-day period with at least 48 hours between tests and</p>
<p>without symptoms or epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 when tested at least three times over a five-day period with at least 48 hours between</p>
<p>tests.</p>
<p>InteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid Test Pro</p>
<p>The InteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid Test Pro is a version of InteliSwab intended for use by healthcare providers at the point of care. The test is performed</p>
<p>in the same manner as the OTC version, except that the test is run and interpreted by a healthcare provider. This test has received EUA from the FDA for</p>
<p>use by laboratories located in the United States certified under CLIA. The Company has also received a CLIA waiver for use of the test, which enables the</p>
<p>test to be used by numerous additional sites in the United States, which are not certified under CLIA, to perform high and moderately complex tests. These</p>
<p>additional sites include outreach clinics, community-based organizations and physicians’ offices. This test is also indicated for individuals aged 2 years and</p>
<p>older, with and without symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>InteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid Test Rx</p>
<p>The InteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid Test Rx is the version of InteliSwab that has received EUA from the FDA for prescription home use with individuals</p>
<p>aged 2 years or older who are suspected of COVID-19 infection by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset.</p>
<p>OraQuick Rapid HIV Test</p>
<p>The OraQuick&reg; Rapid HIV Test is the Company's rapid point-of-care test product designed to test for the presence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. This</p>
<p>product is sold under the OraQuick ADVANCE&reg; name in North America, Europe and certain other countries, and under the OraQuick&reg; name in other</p>
<p>developing countries. The OraQuick ADVANCE&reg; test has received premarket approval (&quot;PMA&quot;) from the FDA for the detection of antibodies to both</p>
<p>HIV-1 and HIV-2 in oral fluid, finger-stick whole blood, venous whole blood and plasma. The OraQuick&reg; test has received World Health Organization</p>
<p>(&quot;WHO&quot;) pre-qualification and registration in other countries for the detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies in oral fluid, whole blood (fingerstick and</p>
<p>venous), serum and plasma. The device uses a porous flat pad to collect an oral fluid specimen. After collection, the pad is inserted into a vial containing a</p>
<p>pre-measured amount of developer solution and allowed to develop. When blood-based specimens are to be tested, a loop collection device is used to</p>
<p>collect a drop of the specimen and mix it in the developer solution, after which the collection pad is inserted into the solution and the test is allowed to</p>
<p>develop. The specimen and developer solution then flow through the testing device</p>

<p>where test results are observable between 20 and 40 minutes. The OraQuick&reg; device is a screening test and requires a confirmation test where an initial</p>
<p>positive result is obtained. This test is available for use by laboratories located in the United States certified under CLIA, to perform moderately complex</p>
<p>tests. The Company has also received a CLIA waiver for use of the test with oral fluid and finger-stick and venous whole blood. As a result, the test can be</p>
<p>used by numerous additional sites in the United States not certified under CLIA to perform moderately complex tests, such as outreach clinics, communitybased organizations and physicians’ offices.</p>
<p>The OraQuick ADVANCE test is also CE marked for sale in Europe and other countries accepting the CE mark for commercialization. This product is also</p>
<p>registered for sale in other countries. The Company has distributors in place for several countries and is seeking to increase awareness and expand its</p>
<p>distribution network for this product throughout the world. The Company has also received WHO pre-qualification for its export-only version of this</p>
<p>product.</p>
<p>OraQuick In-Home HIV Test</p>
<p>The OraQuick In-Home HIV test is an OTC oral-fluid only version of the Company's OraQuick ADVANCE HIV 1&frasl;2 Antibody Test. The Company</p>
<p>received PMA approval to sell this test in the U.S. OTC market. The In-Home test is performed in the same manner as the OraQuick ADVANCE test,</p>
<p>except that it has product labeling and instructions designed for consumers. In addition, the Company has established toll-free, 24&frasl;7, 365-day per year</p>
<p>customer telephone support to provide additional information and referral services for consumers that use this product.</p>
<p>OraQuick HIV Self-Test</p>
<p>The OraQuick HIV Self-Test is sold for use by individuals in certain foreign countries, including under the CE mark in certain European countries, to</p>
<p>meet the needs of those markets. This product has received WHO pre-qualification and is eligible for procurement by purchasing entities entitled to access</p>
<p>funding and other resources from the Global Fund, UNITAID and other agencies.</p>
<p>OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test</p>
<p>Another test available on the OraQuick platform is the OraQuick HCV rapid antibody test. This product is a qualitative test that can detect antibodies to</p>
<p>the hepatitis C virus (&quot;HCV&quot;), in a variety of sample types. The OraQuick HCV test operates in substantially the same manner as the OraQuick</p>
<p>ADVANCE HIV test.</p>
<p>The Company has received FDA PMA approval and CLIA waiver for use of the test in detecting HCV antibodies in venous whole blood and finger-stick</p>
<p>whole blood specimens, making it the first and only rapid HCV test approved by the FDA for use in the United States. The OraQuick HCV test has</p>
<p>received a CE mark for use with oral fluid, venous whole blood, finger-stick whole blood, plasma and serum and is sold in Europe. This CE-marked</p>
<p>product is also registered and sold in other foreign countries and has received WHO pre-qualification.</p>
<p>OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test</p>
<p>The Company has received De Novo authorization from the FDA for its rapid Ebola test, making it the first and only rapid Ebola test cleared for sale in the</p>
<p>U.S. This product utilizes the OraQuick technology platform for the detection of Ebola antigen and can be used with finger-stick and whole blood samples</p>
<p>from live patients and oral fluid samples from recently deceased individuals. The uses for this test are limited to individuals that meet certain criteria</p>
<p>indicating they may be infected with the Ebola virus, so the test is not available for general screening of individuals that do not meet this criteria.</p>
<p>In September 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with BARDA, pursuant to which BARDA will provide up to &#36;8.6 million in funding to the</p>
<p>Company to develop a 2nd generation Ebola test on the OraQuick testing platform with the objective of developing increased sensitivity, utilizing</p>
<p>sustainable raw materials and increasing shelf life, with new chemistry and higher degrees of automation in the test’s manufacturing process. In September</p>
<p>2023, the agreement was modified to add an additional &#36;6.8 million in funding to be used to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals for the product.</p>
<p>Intercept Drug Testing System</p>
<p>A collection device that is substantially similar to the OraSure collection device is sold under the name Intercept , and is used to collect oral mucosal</p>
<p>transudate for oral fluid drug testing. The Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance to use</p>

<p>the Intercept collection device with laboratory-based EIAs to test for drugs-of-abuse commonly identified by the National Institute for Drug Abuse</p>
<p>(&quot;NIDA&quot;) as the NIDA-5 (i.e., tetrahydrocannabinol (&quot;THC&quot; or marijuana), cocaine, opiates, amphetamines&frasl;methamphetamines and phencyclidine</p>
<p>(&quot;PCP&quot;)), and for barbiturates, methadone and benzodiazepines. Each of these EIAs is also FDA 510(k) cleared for use with the Intercept device. The</p>
<p>Intercept device and oral fluid assays are sold in the U.S. primarily through laboratory distributors.</p>
<p>The Company believes that the Intercept device has several advantages over competing urine and other drugs-of-abuse testing products, including its</p>
<p>lower total testing cost, its non-invasive nature, mobility and accuracy, the ease of maintaining a chain-of-custody, the treatment of test subjects with</p>
<p>greater dignity, no requirement for specially-prepared collection facilities and difficulty of sample adulteration. The availability of an oral fluid test is</p>
<p>intended to allow the Company's customers to test for drug impairment and eliminate scheduling costs and inconvenience, thereby streamlining the testing</p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>The Company has also developed a next-generation collection device, which it is marketing under the trade name &quot;Intercept i2 he&quot;. This device offers</p>
<p>several important advantages over the original Intercept device, including a sample adequacy indicator that provides a visual prompt when the appropriate</p>
<p>volume of oral fluid has been collected, the ability to collect a larger sample required by current laboratory testing protocols and a more optimized</p>
<p>chemistry that results in improved recovery of the targeted drug analytes. The Intercept i2 he device is currently being sold as a forensic use only device</p>
<p>within the criminal justice and drug treatment markets along with a panel of fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays that the Company</p>
<p>distributes under an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific.</p>
<p>Immunoassay Tests and Reagents</p>
<p>The Company develops and sell immunoassay tests in formats, known as MICRO-PLATE and AUTO-LYTE , to meet the specific needs of its customers.</p>
<p>The Company also sell fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays developed under its agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific.</p>
<p>The Company's MICRO-PLATE tests can be performed on commonly used instruments and can detect drugs in oral fluid, urine, serum and sweat</p>
<p>specimens. MICRO-PLATE tests are also used as part of the Intercept product line to detect drugs-of-abuse in oral fluid specimens and the Company is</p>
<p>selling a panel of high-throughput assays supplied by Thermo Fisher Scientific to the U.S. forensic market under the agreement described above. AUTOLYTE tests are sold in the form of bottles of liquid reagents, are run on commercially available laboratory-based automated analytical instruments, and are</p>
<p>typically used in high volume, automated, commercial reference insurance laboratories to detect certain drugs or chemicals in urine.
